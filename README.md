# Linked Stage Graph

This repository was created for the hackathon [Coding da Vinci SÃ¼d 2019](https://codingdavinci.de/events/sued/). 

We are creating a knowledge graph using data from the Stuttgart State Theatre. The data set is provided by the [National Archive of Baden-Wuerttemberg](https://www.landesarchiv-bw.de/web) and consists of almost 7.000 photographs from the theater (on and off the stage) a long with a variety of metadata.

Our goal is to privide an endpoint to easily access the data using SPARQL and to create simple visualization to get an initial idea of the interesting photographs provided.
